# Exercise task

* Create an entity User with personal data parameters;
* User CRUD functions;
* User signup process;
* Create a crypto wallet (just a one to one record on a db) upon user signup. You can choose any crypto currency you want for the wallet (ex. BTC, ETH). The wallet doesn't have to be a real one, but you can make sure using a regex that the address generated follows addresses standards (ex. BTC wallets always start either with the characters 1, 3 or bc).
* External API integration for getting real-time currency (example https://rapidapi.com/collection/list-of-free-apis)
* User's authentication process;

The application must be developed using Java using Spring/Spring Boot and a sql database.
